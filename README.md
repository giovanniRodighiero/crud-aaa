# CRUD-AAA: Create Read Update Delete - Agnostic API Admin
* CRUD: performs the basic CRUD operations;
* Agnostic: runs completely on the client, so it can be paired with whatever backend language and stack;
* API: since it runs in the client it is built as an API driven SPA, event the main configuration object can be provided through a dedicated endpoint.

## Still under development, NOT ready for production since some key features are still missing.
